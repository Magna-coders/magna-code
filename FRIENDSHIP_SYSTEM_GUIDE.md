# Friendship System Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to implement a proper friendship system that shows only connected friends on the friends webpage.

## Database Setup

### 1. Run the Friendship Schema
First, execute the friendship schema to create the necessary tables and functions:

```bash
# Run this SQL file to create the friendship system
psql -d your_database_name -f create-friendship-schema.sql
```

### 2. Add Test Data (Optional)
To test the system, you can add sample data:

```bash
# Run this to add test friend requests and connections
psql -d your_database_name -f test-friendship-data.sql
```

**Note**: You'll need to replace the UUIDs in the test data with actual user IDs from your database.

## How It Works

### Database Structure

1. **friend_requests table**: Stores friend requests with status (pending, accepted, declined, cancelled)
2. **friends table**: Stores bidirectional friend relationships
3. **Views**: 
   - `user_friends`: Shows all friends for a user with their details
   - `pending_friend_requests`: Shows pending requests for a user

### Key Features

1. **Only Connected Friends**: The friends page now only shows users who have accepted friend requests
2. **Connection Requests**: Users can see and manage incoming friend requests
3. **Bidirectional Relationships**: When User A accepts User B's request, both become friends
4. **Real-time Updates**: Accepting/declining requests immediately updates the UI

### Security

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Ensures users can only see their own friends and requests
- **Authentication**: All queries are filtered by the authenticated user ID
- **Data Integrity**: Database functions handle the complex logic of accepting requests

## Frontend Implementation

The friends page (`app/friends/page.tsx`) now:

1. **Fetches real data**: Uses Supabase queries instead of mock data
2. **Shows only connected friends**: Queries the `user_friends` view
3. **Manages requests**: Shows pending requests from `pending_friend_requests` view
4. **Handles actions**: Uses database functions for accept/decline operations

## Next Steps

### 1. Send Friend Requests
To allow users to send friend requests, you can:

- Add a "Connect" button on member profiles
- Create a search/add friends interface
- Implement friend suggestion logic

### 2. Enhanced Features
Consider adding:

- Friend request notifications
- Block/unblock functionality
- Friend groups or categories
- Activity feeds for friends

### 3. Performance Optimization
For larger user bases:

- Add pagination to friend lists
- Implement caching for friend data
- Optimize database indexes

## Testing the System

1. **Create multiple user accounts** in your application
2. **Send friend requests** between users (you'll need to implement the UI for this)
3. **Accept/decline requests** on the friends page
4. **Verify only connected friends** appear in the friends list

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **No friends showing up**: Check that the friendship schema is properly installed
2. **Permission errors**: Verify RLS policies are correctly configured
3. **Request acceptance fails**: Ensure the database functions are created properly

### Debug Queries:

```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name IN ('friend_requests', 'friends');

-- Check if views exist
SELECT * FROM information_schema.views WHERE table_name IN ('user_friends', 'pending_friend_requests');

-- Test RLS policies
SELECT * FROM friend_requests WHERE auth.uid() = 'your-user-id';
```

This implementation ensures that the friends webpage only shows users who have mutually accepted friend requests, creating a proper social connection system similar to Facebook or LinkedIn.
