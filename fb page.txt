🧠 Full AI Design Prompt: Magna Coders Dashboard (Facebook-Style Layout)

Design a web dashboard UI for the Magna Coders Community App using a three-panel Facebook-style layout with a creative, collaborative feel.

💡 Design Intention for AI

Create a warm, modern dashboard inspired by Facebook’s main layout —

Use the provided color palette (cream background, red/black/orange accents)
and design with rounded, clean cards that invite interaction and collaboration.
